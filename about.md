My name is Yao Xiao, and my Chinese name is 萧尧 (xiāo yáo). I am an undergraduate (currently in junior year) majoring in Honors Mathematics and Computer Science at NYU Shanghai. During the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters, I am studying away in New York.

I was Learning Assistant for Calculus (MATH-SHU.0131) during the Fall 2021 semester at Department of Mathematics, NYU Shanghai. I am also currently Tutor for undergraduate Operating Systems (CSCI-UA.0202) during the Spring 2023 semester at Department of Computer Science, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

I am really interested in Mathematical Sciences, Computer Science, and programming. I also like playing the piano in my spare time. Currently, I aim to become a software engineer in the future.
